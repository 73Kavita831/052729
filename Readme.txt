3.1KS18CS029 - KAVITA CHAUDHARY

CONTRIBUTION OF TEAM MEMBERS
1.ANUSHRUTI SINGH-FOUND COMMANDLINE ARGUMENTS AND CODE
2.K.K.PAVITHRA-LOGIC OF THE PROGRAM AND HELPED IN CODE AND EXECUTION OF PROGRAM ON LINUX
3.KAVITA CHAUDHARY-TO MAKE THE PROGRAM EFFICIENT SHE GAVE THE LOGIC OF NO. OF ROTATION AND HELPED IN CODING

INSTRUCTION 
OPEN THE PROGRAM compile : gcc leftr.c -o leftr\n
run : ./leftr \"string\" <number of rotate>\n
leftr.c is the file name
string,no.of rotate are the input as per the user.
If you want to change the value in macro you can change.
EXAMPLES
 1 ./leftr "abcde" 2
    OUTPUT- cdeab
 2 ./leftr "naina" 3000
    OUTPUT- naina

CHALLENGES FACED
1-usage of commandLine arguments.
2-In case no. of rotations are 0 programs is efficient.
3-to make memory space efficient we faced problems.

HOW DID WE OVERCOME
1.We inculcated commandline arguments from google
2.To make no. of rotations efficient we have used modulus(%)
3.To accomplish the program we took help from website.

WHAT DID WE LEARNT FROM THE ASSIGNMENT
We learnt how to use command line arguments.
